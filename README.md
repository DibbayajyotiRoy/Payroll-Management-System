# Advanced Rust Payroll System API

This project is a high-performance, next-generation payroll management system built with Rust, Axum, and PostgreSQL. It's designed to be a robust backend supporting cutting-edge features like AI-powered analytics, real-time payroll processing, blockchain integration, and advanced employee self-service.

## Features
- **High Performance:** Built with Rust and the Axum framework for speed and safety.
- **Asynchronous:** Fully async from the web layer down to the database.
- **Modern Database:** Uses PostgreSQL with `sqlx` for compile-time query checking.
- **Advanced Data Models:** Supports complex JSON-based data structures for analytics, benefits, and more.
- **Ready for the Future:** Designed to integrate AI, blockchain, and real-time payment features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [sqlx-cli](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/tree/main/sqlx-cli) (`cargo install sqlx-cli`)

### Installation & Running
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd advanced-payroll
    ```

2.  **Set up the environment:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your database URL:
    ```.env
    DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@localhost/your_db_name"
    ```

3.  **Run database migrations:**
    This will create and update your database tables to match the application's models.
    ```bash
    sqlx migrate run
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    cargo run --release
    ```
    The server will start on `http://0.0.0.0:3000`.
